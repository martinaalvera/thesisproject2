# Galaxy 20.01

I tried to install Galaxy 20.01, following the tutorial “Galaxy Installation with Ansible” provided by The Galaxy Project (https://galaxyproject.github.io/training-material/topics/admin/tutorials/ansible-galaxy/tutorial.html).    
Some basic variables presented in the tutorial were modified to adapt the settings of Galaxy to the ones provided by Laniakea System (https://laniakea-elixir-it.github.io/)
